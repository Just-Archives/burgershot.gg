			<description><![CDATA[Ultimamente nossos policiais estão sofrendo correndo atrás de Lázaro (400 soldados atrás de 1 pessoa), eles cercaram a área e ainda não pegaram o infeliz.<br />
<br />
Ele estava na prisão, tinha direito a uma "pequena saída" (algo como: você está livre por um tempo, fuja)<br />
<br />
Pior, eles desarmaram a sociedade (mas não os bandidos), não temos prisão perpétua e as leis que temos não o mantêm na prisão.<br />
<br />
Lázaro está 16 dias no mato, mais de 400 policiais incluindo cães de caça e boa tecnologia e quando pego pode pegar no máximo 4 anos de prisão por assassinato em série<br />
<br />
Se isso acontecesse lá, a lei seria tão frouxa quanto no Brasil?]]></description>

For me personally, I've been struggling with this thought for quite some time, for two long years I had been waiting to get past a tough period in life where I had no time for myself and now when I'm through, it doesn't seem as joyous as I had imagined, in fact, The reasons which drove me through my tough 2 years just don't excite me anymore! I just lay in bed or eat or casually chat around with friends. Is it just me or does this happen with you all as well? If yes, how does one cope :(]]></description>
