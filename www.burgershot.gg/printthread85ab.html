<strong>Looking for a new server/community to join!</strong> - <a href="memberc2fc.html?action=profile&amp;uid=12">Potassium</a> -  <strong>2020-01-30</strong>

Hi friends! Long-ish time, no see :(<br />
<br />
I have terrible internet now so SA-MP is probably one of few online games I can play in the limited time I have to play games lol<br />
<br />
I want to find a new server to play and be a part of. I'm a bit out of the loop these days, so I'm not sure what's still popular, what's still good, etc.<br />
<br />
Please leave your suggestions below, but ONLY if they meet the criteria that I list below. This is not an opportunity to advertise servers that aren't relevant to the thread!<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for in a server:<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Active, regular players.</span> Server has a decent number of players online 24/7<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Main language is English</span>, staff are fluent in English and easy to communicate with (it's fine if players speak other languages in game!)<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">GOOD STAFF. </span>I guess I'm looking for a server that isn't super strict. No power-trippy 14 year old bullshit anymore. I'm a grown-ass adult now and want to play with other grown-ass adults (maybe I'm in the wrong place? lmao)<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.</span> Dev team that actively works on improving the server, implementing suggestions and bug fixes etc.<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">THINGS TO WORK TOWARDS.</span> I like games where I can spend time grinding for results. Achievements, missions, ranks, jobs - that sort of thing. Things I can do by myself when no friends are online.<br />
<br />
- <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">THINGS TO DO WITH FRIENDS.</span> I also want to be able to play with friends. Group activities etc<br />
<br />
That's pretty much it, I think.<br />
<br />
I enjoy things like owning houses etc but it's not a deal-breaker if the server doesn't have those features.<br />
<br />
I've never really played RP servers but I'm willing to try low-level ones for now, if they are good.<br />
<br />
Happy to play round-based servers like Sumo etc too.<br />
<br />
Basically I just want to have a good time with and without friends, and be a part of a good community again :)<br />
<br />
So show me what's out there please! â™¥
