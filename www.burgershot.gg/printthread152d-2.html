Hey guys, just a little sneak peak of what i came across today, i got an idea in my head i manage to make a real mirror that reflects everything what is in front of it. This are only couple objects grouped together, but in near future I hope that ill make a realistic object of mirror to implement every thing together to look even more realistic for Roleplay servers. <br />
<br />
Tell me what do you think?<br />

Ammm..<br />
This is like 2 years old thing lol<br />
TRM and Vlad Ganevich, 2 super good mappers from russia used this thing long time ago.. (other mappers as well, but i saw more of this in their maps)<br />
They even managed to make like different shapes of mirrors even perfect circles with lighting lol<br />
And reflective floor, became super popular because both of them started to use them a lot..<br />
I hope i am not wrong but i am sure they took this to the next level, even if someone found out this before..<br />
<br />
But mirror idea itself is cool, like it is in San Andreas game, so it is not a surprise that we can make it in maps lol.. <br />
In other words it is in game since 2004 xd<br />
<br />
Anyway, good job on making one as well! :3
