<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>EditClientMessage(messageid, color, string[]);</code></div></div><br />
would be a nice edition so we won't need to spam countdowns/percentages in chat.<br />
<hr class="mycode_hr" />
but should be similar to CreateObject texturing, like:<br />
<br />
[/code]<br />
new lol = SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "hi");<br />
<br />
EditClientMessage(lol, 0xFF0000FF, "hello");
<br />

Should use a textdraw or GameTextFor* functions instead of spamming the chat.

Point is to not have to spam the chat.<br />
<br />
I agree with the suggestion, let's keep in mind the mentioned example is just one of many uses (as the example, as mentioned, is just as fine with other functions)<br />
<br />
Think editable messages, either by admins or by yourself: Being able to fix typos without spamming the chat, admins "deleting" offensive messages sent by other players, repeatedly changing the text or color of a message to make it blink or otherwise attract attention (For important warnings or updates etc.)<br />
<br />
TL;DR: I support this suggestion

This doesn't make much sense to do really.<br />
<br />
The chat isn't designed nor should it be designed to alter it, it's not like Discord where you can edit a message on the fly. The chat is designed to serve the purpose of sending messages to the client,<br />
it wouldn't make sense to implement this sort of idea. This would also cause confusion about logs, as some servers I know rely on logs for evidence, and if it was possible to change this on the fly it would ruin it's credibility (just an example of it's use).<br />
<br />
This isn't a feature I would see people dying to have, and I wouldn't use it myself. You have textdraws which was previously mentioned which can do exactly this.

Im pretty sure OP didnt meant the chat itself to be editable, only the SendClientMessage s from server so if he send a message on OnPlayerConnect with the message "You connected to the server", at OnPlayerSpawn he would edit that message with something like "You spawned" or something instead of sending 2 different messages<br />
<br />
Imo it has few use cases but overall is kinda useless

I think it'd be good to anti spam purposes (if I'm understanding this correctly, the function would be able to edit a client message BEFORE its sent out) where someone spams a server IP into the chat for advertisements or something to simply block certain words or phrases from being seen in the message.
