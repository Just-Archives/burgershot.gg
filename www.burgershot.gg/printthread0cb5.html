What about the progress of open.mp. I know it's hard to predict a date. But overall how much of the dev teams expectations has been implemented into the code? (Would love for a percentage answer if possible.)<br />

<br />
1.  How would you guys combat clone/ replica servers that do not contribute anything useful and often times leech of the main server's playerbase?<br />
2.  How do you guys plan on spreading the word about open.mp to other lingual communities, such as when the Forum and Wiki down post is only available in English.<br />

On Discord it was said to be around Christmas, but waiting can probably bring better answer as we get closer to it.

What type of new features are you planning for new versions?<br />
What is the next step for open.mp after it reaches SA-MP flow, can you tell us a little more about your plans and ideas?<br />
What are new ideas that could be done in an old game like GTA SA that open.mp will cover?

DON'T remove it. Some players refuse to play in servers that have it 'disabled'. CBug is considered to be a skill.

2. First release is the server only so that's not doable I think (and prob won't be if SAMP client stays compatible with the open.mp server forever) <br />

<br />
As Pinch as I am, my question will be:<br />
Does open.mp server actually include any kind of performance upgrade if we compare it to the sa-mp server?<br />
I know everything goes through the same raknet stuff but like is it more balanced internally before it is sent to raknet at all? Like player pools n' stuff that actually can be more balanced internally?<br />
Because iirc that SA-MP functions (for example SendClientMessageToAll) are using simple word loop through player pool which means IsPlayerConnected is always called (for example Y_Less created Player iterator to avoid this in PAWN)

The correct solution would be to implement a toggle switch for it. Also there are already methods to detecting these bugs, some DM servers have c-bug detection, moonwalk wouldn't be hard to detect either. Leaving it would be important for the DM community since these glitches have a skill element to them. If you just disable it as a whole giving no options you will anger the DM community.

<br />
1. If you could choose any networking library other than RakNet - which one would it be and why?<br />
2. Will sampctl/openctl be the (semi-)official package manager for open.mp?<br />
3. What are open.mp's current build times?<br />
4. Which tools do you use for reverse engineering?<br />
5. Will current cheat tools for SA:MP still work for open.mp?<br />
6. Since you're renaming plugins to modules and includes to libraries (thank god), are you also renaming filterscripts?<br />
7. What are you most looking forward to once the first version of open.mp is released?<br />
8. Will open.mp have semver or kalver?

Some players refuse to play in servers that have it 'disabled'. CBug is considered to be a skill.</blockquote><br />
Yes, in 2020/21 it is probably a skill... <span style="color: #333333;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;" class="mycode_font">if you use CLEO and other cheats for it.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
Just fix cbug, spacebug, moonwalk and all other bugs in the game, I'm sick of players abusing it.</blockquote><br />
It has been a "skill" for many years now.<br />
I'm not a fan of it either, but apparently some players love it.</blockquote><br />
The correct solution would be to implement a toggle switch for it. Also there are already methods to detecting these bugs, some DM servers have c-bug detection, moonwalk wouldn't be hard to detect either. Leaving it would be important for the DM community since these glitches have a skill element to them. If you just disable it as a whole giving no options you will anger the DM community.</blockquote><br />
can't agree any more mate</blockquote><br />
DM community is ruined a long time ago by cheaters and so proclaimed "cbug skill players". But I'm always for it to be an optional. Anyway we need a fix for all bugs, including those which can be stated as "features".
