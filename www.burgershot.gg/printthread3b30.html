<strong>Problem with OnPlayerDeath</strong> - <a href="member02c6.html?action=profile&amp;uid=3448">destiezk</a> -  <strong>2021-03-11</strong>
<br />
<br />
Dear everyone,<br />
<br />
I've been facing this issue for almost 2-3 months which I can NOT solve by myself.<br />
The problem is that OnPlayerDeath is not really running correctly. I have a modified hitbox on my server which modifies the damage, and idk if it could be the problem.<br />
The problem is: Randomly when you die, an irritating bug appears which is after you die, your character can stand up and shoot finely for like 1-2 seconds, and then dies, but the funniest is that my code at OnPlayerDeath runs correctly, just suddenly this appears.<br />
I tried to solve it multiple ways, like putting a check if the player is ONFOOT at the end of OnPlayerDeath, but didn't seem to fix my issue, and been stuck with this as I already mentioned for months.<br />
Anyone faced this before?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!
<br />

I saw this but did not decide to fix it and ignored it. This problem is only seen in lagshot. <br />
<br />
You can fix this problem by playing the death animation when the player dies.<br />
Also if you want, you can use weapon-config include to solve it.

I'm not using lagshot, but it still appears.<br />
<br />
I'll try the death-animation when the player dies, thank you so much :-)

If the problem appeared 2-3 months ago, revert your code to a version from 4 months ago and bisect from there.  Once you've found the commit that the bug was introduced in, then you have a much better idea of what caused it and we can help you go from there.

It's because of my custom hitbox, but I have no clue why
