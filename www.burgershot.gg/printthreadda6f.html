Useful in the modern society or not? Waste of time? What would you like to be changed?

The entire concept of "schools" is outdated. Putting people on the same level - giving the exact same subject matter to every single student is delusional. People excel at different things and should be given curriculum based on their personal level of knowledge. They should not get the same as their fellow students.<br />
<br />
Some people aren't good at math but they're good with languages. Someone might not be good with languages but excels at math. There are reports of homeschooled children doing better than children that go to public schools by a large margin.<br />
<br />
Opening a book and having to study it for a test which determines whether you pass or fail the class. That's retarded.

The way the schooling system works is extremely outdated in my honest opinion. You learn through practice and not repetition of words on a notebook.

School is there to help you find what you like. Uni is for actually learning stuff.
