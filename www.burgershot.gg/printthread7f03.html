I've started working on a racing gamemode recently, i've had the idea of making it like NFS games. But now i'm stuck thinking about should i make it focused on the racing or add roleplay aspects to it as well? Pretty much what you could've done in NFS games is just race, and making a SA:MP server solely on racing sounds a bit boring to me, and adding a bit of roleplay aspects might spice it up a bit, so the players won't get bored? Anyways, im looking for ideas/suggestions, the more original the better. So im calling out the racing enthusiasts to help me with ideas in making a truly unique server experience, and yes you will get a part on the staff team as well, so no good ideas will go to waste.<br />
<br />
You can PM me here, or on Discord: Escobar#0607<br />
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

I am looking for a decent team for a roleplay server, who can handle with any task depending on the position, so knowledge, experience, skill, creativity, and aesthetics are required. I also need your previous works or something that proves your value. Another advantage is the knowledge of roleplay servers. I also appreciate rising stars and who will surprise me in every way or just think. Everything has to be created from scratch with the combination of the old and the new climate (scripted and gameplay part mostly). I bet on professionalism<br />
<br />
Who i'm looking for:<br />
<br />
programmer/scripter<br />
webdeveloper <br />
media team (video, graphics)<br />
mapper and modeler<br />
marketing team<br />
<br />
and ... maybe someone who will surprise me in many other fields and prove that I will choose him from among other candidates, they can be people such as consultants, helpers with legal or illegal fields or people who have the knowledge and/or experience about medic, police, etc and would help for example in the case of creating an advanced realistic police system like mdc or played realistic games or with a realistic system such as Euro Truck (so they know how it all works with details) and everything in terms of and/or matching/suitable to roleplay, maybe related to gameplay, ideas, plan (maybe there is something that will surprise players, it will be different, it has never been introduced, you always wanted on a roleplay server, but nobody implemented it or maybe is a different reason), etc so may be people from every community, gameplay, types of roleplay like light, medium, heavy, text-based, voice-based, etc. of course according to my vision, so it will be verified<br />
<br />
What method of payment? paypal, but we can find something that will be a good option for both of us. I will pay for a specific part of the work, for example, the script in the case of programming, but I don't send the entire amount before work<br />
