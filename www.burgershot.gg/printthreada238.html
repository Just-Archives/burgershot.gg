This is what happens when you mention OpenMP on SAMP forums:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">You have been banned for the following reason:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">promoting some hacked version of samp</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Date the ban will be lifted: Never</span><br />
<br />
Pretty pathetic, considering SAMP isn't even being developed anymore. Hurry up and release OpenMP and put everybody out of their misery lol.

What is a "hacked version of samp"? Are they calling open.mp a version of SA-MP now or what? lmao

I think they're implying Y_Less stole parts of SAMP to make his new version.<br />
<br />
Considering Y_Less did more for the community than anybody, and his plugins probably attracted more people than it would have. Why would they even be bothered about OpenMP anyway? If you've abandoned development on the project, that project is eventually going to fade out. If anything they should be collaborating with and supporting OpenMP to keep San Andreas Multiplayer alive.<br />
<br />
God help us all if we have to use MTA...

Please don't post links to the leaked source code.<br />
Also, our entire code base is not even remotely similar to SA-MP, the most similar part would be the RakNet library, even then, that's a few minor versions difference! They can claim whatever, they'll see soon enough, or just be ignorant and continue to spew the lies.<br />
<br />
open.mp is still being worked on, but most of us have our lives to deal with such as jobs, I work on it when I can.

<br />
As Josh said, open.mp isn't even close to being alike with SA-MP's (leaked) source code, iirc the PAWN is just there for backwards compatibility &amp; I suppose that means that natives wont be called through PAWN VM

PAWN is still our main language, and it will be forever (for SA at least). We do export the functions so any plugin can just import them and call them directly rather than going through the fake AMX instance like sampgdk.

Didn't GTA United use a leaked version?

<br />
GTA United was granted permission by Kalcor to redistribute SA-MP files, but I think it was just a simple mod that extended SA-MP (think of a DLL that just memory hacks SA-MP) and not actually ship a new version of SA-MP, could be wrong though.
