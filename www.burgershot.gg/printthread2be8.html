Hey<br />
 <br />
I was a bit confused about what this actually is, I read the FAQ so all the smart-ass people can f off with the "go the read..." <br />
<br />
is this gonna be a new multiplayer mod like SA-MP and it will have a new hosting platform like Game-MP or is this just a better version of the already existing SA-MP
<br />

At first it will be a mode compatible with sa-mp. Some new features will be proposed and some bugs will be fixed.

I was really impressed to see the player count on SA-MP, for Kalcor to just give up on such a huge player base is extremely ignorant, most triple A games don't even have half that amount of players, I would love to see this becoming a thing of itself rather than a minor improvement over something I believe has died or is dying, I can't emphasize how disappointed I am from the SA-MP team and how proud I am of someone like Y_Less who actually cared enough for the community and saw the potential and is doing this, hopefully the team can make something like a Game-MP or a hosted tab so they can make money and keep updating the game<br />
<br />
I'm still learning code but I would absolutely love to contribute and help this project in whatever shape or form I can

I think OpenMP will be best game for RolePlay

open.mp is a modification for the GTA:SA, not a game :')
