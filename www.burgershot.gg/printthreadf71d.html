<strong>Discordia - PvP &amp; PvE (Player Vs Player, Player Vs Environment)</strong> - <a href="member7079.html?action=profile&amp;uid=850">[SF]kAn3</a> -  <strong>2021-10-18</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hello. <br />
<br />
As the subject says, this is a gamemode I was working on during my free time. <br />
I've decided to share it with anyone who's interested in working on it, I really liked how it was going to be, maybe some of you will give it a real life!<br />
<br />
This gamemode is focused on PVP and PVE, taking place in a fictionary world, where players need to strive to survive, building their camp, fighting NPCs and other players, join/fight clans, build your player and levelup, scavenge the world for resources, food, water, weapons and so on.<br />
<br />
I am NOT going to update this, things may change, but as for now I won't touch the code anymore ever, so don't ask me anything and feel free to do what you like with it!<br />
Also, you will have to find all the needed plugins, I don't have them anymore!<br />
<br />
Here I will post some videos:<br />
