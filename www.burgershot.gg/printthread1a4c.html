<strong>The open.mp should be released</strong> - <a href="memberca74.html?action=profile&amp;uid=3956">NoxxeR</a> -  <strong>2021-07-15</strong>
<br />
<br />
Even though some people think open.mp will not be good, this thread for example: https://www.burgershot.gg/showthread.php?tid=464<br />
<br />
I think the open.mp team should release a version, here is the reason:<br />
<br />
Sa-mp is more stable than MTA, i've played mta years ago, and it crashes more than sa-mp.<br />
<br />
Open-mp has backward compatibility, thats something awesome and good.<br />
<br />
Sa-mp has more servers than MTA:SA and this should be released.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Hows the progress on open.mp? When will a release be expected? This game is so awesome, and its not getting old by days.<br />

// NoxxeR</blockquote>SA:MP is not stable at all, it can crash for whatever reason because it does not handle with the game very well. Also - pretty sure MTA:SA have way more servers than SA:MP.<br />
Open.MP should be released when its fully stable, if it will be released too soon, it could just fail, marked as unstable, low-end product that isn't good either for players or developers.

For me Sa-mp might have crashed 50 times in 2 years of playing, thats not so many times. Mostly if someone in the server lags alot.<br />
<br />
When i played mtavc, it crashed every hour or something, this was back in 2004. SA-MP is a good client, and not that bad, i hope open.mp will be better though!

And btw, since MTA:VC(0.5) it got full rewrite, because its now OpenSource, and back then the code was Closed, so it could not be used due to licenses.<br />
<br />
MTA:SA in 2004 was setting its first steps really, now its one of the biggest multiplayer games in the world tbh, doing statements looking at 17 YEARS BACK, is really... not smart.

Almost every month someone asks when are they releasing it, take a look at the progress nobody opened anything in months don't expect anything to happen honestly. Developers are not saying a word to the community pretty much it's the same situation what we had on the main SA-MP forum.

They've been talking about the development lately in their Discord and looks like they're close to the finishing line, it only needs some polishing. Let's hope everything will be fine, fingers crossed!

Why would I need to contact anyone to get answers about the progress? <br />
<br />
Isn't it why this https://open.mp/progress was made for? If it ain't being used no point of having it. I never made false assumptions, that's what the community can see, lack of communication of the progress. Members are not just here to give out suggestions they expect something back as well. You do you, not my business anymore.

I'm sorry if you are hurt by what I said earlier, but it's true, open.mp/progress is from old version of website and we only added it to new version AGAIN because you guys were asking for it, even though we have already mentioned hundreds of times, not everything is public and we don't do full transparency, yet again you're here complaining about that.<br />
<br />
If you think there's no point of having that webpage, it's open source and it's on our github, it's as easy as removing a directory so hand us a help if you think it's necessary and remove it, make a Pull Request, and if everything went good, we accept your removal of progress page.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>lack of communication of the progress</blockquote>
Communication of progress? what does that mean? is it still about the webpage or you mean lack of communication with team members? because obviously second one has been an option since very beginning, you can tag any of team members on discord and ask whatever you want even if it's not related to open.mp development :)<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite> You do you, not my business anymore.</blockquote>
Great attitude, hope I've answered all of your questions and unclear opinions <br />
<br />
And at last, here's a proof it's not dead and it's being worked on<br />
null<br />
if you can't have it, it's your issue, so I let you decide to believe or not.<br />
<br />
Have a great day.

All you've been doing is sending meaningless s**t that's already been sent TWO YEARS AGO...<br />
<br />
<br />

How that makes any sense, the first release is server only (or for idiots: the samp-server.exe file), that means you already can do the exact same stuff you'd be able to do on the first release so what's the point of hurrying it up?
