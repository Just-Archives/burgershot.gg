I can read and write Urdu and English. I've extensive interest in Russian, French and German and can read and understand them slightly, speaking is no option for me... I also speak and understand Arabic, but I've no interest in it at all.<br />
<br />
What languages do I want to learn or improve? The ones I mentioned before: German, French and Russian.<br />
<br />
What languages I hate? I don't really hate, but I only like the aforementioned languages (except Arabic).<br />
<br />
The role model for learning languages is my dad, who speaks/ understands around 10 languages almost fluently.

My native language is Ukrainian. <br />
But I also speak Russian as native (with a little accent).<br />
<br />
My English is about ~B1-B2<br />
And I know Polish in ~B1.<br />
<br />
So, I know 4 languages.<br />
<br />
I want to learn Japanese and Spanish and maybe French. But I dont't think I would start to learn them in the near future.. =(

I'm just terrible at languages.  I have very good English, being from England, but almost nothing else unfortunately.  I did French in school but just didn't care, also German but cared even less - I can now count to 6 and that's it.  I have, however, been learning Russian for the last few years, but you wouldn't be able to tell it has been that long given how bad I am.<br />
<br />
I'm a qualified TEFL teacher though.

So, you are just not into the learning languages.<br />
It's common when a person don't have much motivation to learn a language.<br />
I think if you know English, you can afford not to learn something else. There are many things in English (movies, books, guides, articles and so on) and people don't have much motivation to lern something else, only if being interested in it.. I think so

I never intended to learn any Language, but I learned Japanese through Anime (and having Japanese friends) and I dated a Korean girl for 4 years so I learned quite a lot. As for the Mandarin I picked some up watching Chinese movies and before I knew it, I was able to have a half decent conversation in it.

I speak Estonian as my native language and have been learning English at school for about 7 years now, but learned most of it on SA-MP and internet in general. I've also been learning Russian for 3 years, but I'm absolutely bad at speaking it as we're being taught furniture items, clothes and vegetables year over year with no progress being made. I'd probably like to take a proper Russian course after graduating to be able to at least tell where's the closest liquor store to a Russian and maybe Finnish / German.

I want to move to Russia, and have many Russian friends. Its not a lack of motivation, its a lack of time and ability. I am just very bad at languages.

<br />
As a finn, I speak Finnish natively and have been force-fed Swedish since primary school. I'm mediocre at Swedish.<br />
I studied a few courses of Russian in high school and know the cyrillic alphabet and a few basic words and sentences.<br />
I currently live with my German girlfriend with whom I speak English. My university studies are also often very English-heavy so I use more English than Finnish in my day-to-day life. We live in Finland, though, so not like my Finnish would be going anywhere.<br />
Despite the German girlfriend, my German is still almost non-existent. Considering I pretty much never properly studied it, I've picked up surprisingly much from visiting Germany a total of 10 weeks so far, but I really can't speak a single sentence.<br />
<br />
I always was interested in languages and became fluent in English at a very young age, mostly because of the internet and the international social connections I made through it. I think my biggest obstacle in learning new / improving on my current languages is that except for Finnish and English, my brain really doesn't want to learn new vocabulary at all for whatever reason. Everything else about Swedish I was always good/average at, but come time for the word test and I barely score any points. Every time. This, of course, then always reflected in my course grades and makes learning Swedish difficult in general, as not knowing even half the words I've already been taught makes studying excruciatingly slow.

That's all interesting, I thought I was the only one interested in languages.<br />
Guys, for those of you who are interested in learning any language, I recommend watching the following video:<br />
[Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA</a>]<br />
After watching it, I understood why most people study languages at school and rarely become good at it. <br />
The guy in the video learned to speak Arabic in 1 year without studying anything, he just naturally acquired it. The video is more than 1 hour length, but it's absolutely worth it, and this is being said by a person who does not watch a video if it's longer than 9:59 minutes. The guy is not selling anything, nor promoting any product or website, he is just documenting his experience.

Sir, if you literally had to pick the worst two languages to learn - that'd be your answer :D<br />
<br />
German is awful (it's just ugly, <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">#nohate</span>, it's not fluent at all and writing and spelling is literally over-complicated) (I speak German as I was forced to learn it because Education system in Serbia is non-existent.)<br />
While the french on the other hand is German but at least its fluent (it's still horrible as words have nothing to do with each other) <br />
<br />
I am from Serbia, I don't really like the language here (other reasons) but this language is very fluent, easy to read (Literally when I write Ракија, I read it like Ракија and spell it like Р а к и ј а.) &amp; it's understandable<br />
<br />
Because even if you miss like 5 letters in a word 6 letters long word (let's say that you drunk too much of Ракија &amp; you're not sober), people will easily understand what you wrote without any difficulty.<br />
<br />
https://www.quora.com/Is-Serbian-hard-to-learn<br />
Many say that Serbian is hard language to learn, it probably is because of our strict grammar (who tf learns Serbian tho) but it's very clear as I said
