If you want to play on a server which owned by an arrogant jerk, then this is your server! The features are good - but this is the only positive side of the server. There are a lot of stupid rules like you cannot talk different language even in your own organization chat or private messages. Oh yes, private messages. This is should called as personal messages here because admins can read your private messages and everything else, so your privacy is not exist here. <br />
Most of the administrators are jerks too, you can easily get muted or banned if you message them something which they don't like and if you're a pro player time to get ready for bunch of bans because they will ban you for cheating. Oh I almost forgot. The anticheat system is good against cheaters, but also good to punish legit players for no reason. Your packetloss will be high on the server which means you'll got kicked multiple times per day, most of the time you'll lose all your weapons which won't be refunded because of 'lags'. <br />
<br />
So if you're fine with theese go and play on this fantastic server! ;)

Hello, Thanks for replying I made this reply to comment on your text above, So, First of all, I don't know why you complain about something such as this, Let's talk about the rules, yes that is true you're not allowed to speak anythingÂ else than English in main chat or organization chatÂ but this doesn't go for private messages, you can speak any language you want, we don't mute for that, and by the way, if any player report you for harassment /insulting in PM's then yes we will take actions on your behavior and issue you a mute, and no privacy exists<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Staff Team is experienced and professional and always monitored by higher ranks for any abuse/lack of responsibility, if your cheating, your cheating, and we will investigate and do our work, our Anticheat is very accurate and the logs are only shown to staff members not to you or your brother or parents so no need to cry if your getting kicked for lags then means your connection is poor or you are far away from our server host try to upgrade your net, and we do not refund for your own mistakes<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that answers your question, and we hope you get my point and see you in our server soon.
<br />
