<strong>How to help</strong> - <a href="membere2a3.html?action=profile&amp;uid=6">Y_Less</a> -  <strong>2019-04-14</strong>
<br />
<br />
Right now there is a lot happening - I'm being absolutely flooded with messages, and I appreciate all of them!  Thank you for all the support.  It is taking me a while to sort through them though, so if I miss you out I sincerely apologise!<br />
<br />
By far the most common question is, how can I help?  So I'm going to address this here:<br />
<br />
1) Keep pushing the message.  Tell anyone and everyone.  Get your favourite server owners in here, get your friends and clans on board.  The biggest danger is that while we are riding high right now things will calm down and return to the old status-quo.  Thus while we sort through everything and get organised we need to keep that pressure up.<br />
<br />
2) Very similar to the above - use these forums.  Post pictures of your cats (post pictures of your dogs too I guess, if you're in to that sort of thing), ask scripting questions, re-release your scripts and includes, post screenshots and videos (you can even use you(them)tube).  Basically normalise using these forums for anything you used the official SA:MP forums for before.  But most importantly - post pictures of your cats!<br />
<br />
3) Don't insult anyone.  We may have issues with the way things had been run before, but that doesn't mean we go after the people themselves.<br />
<br />
4) We need a list of SA:MP bugs, a nice thorough one.  Start compiling them, or how will we know if we've fixed them?  I'll get my bugtracker up (or that's something else someone could work on - fiixing this bugzilla error:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>Encode version 2.87 required--this is only version 2.60 at /usr/share/perl5/Email/MIME/ContentType.pm line 7.<br />
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/share/perl5/Email/MIME/ContentType.pm line 7.<br />

BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /var/www/bugs.y-less.com/index.cgi line 15.</code></div></div><br />
I'm sure it's not hard, it's just 2am here.<br />
<br />
5) Related to above - tests.  So we can prove bugs are gone.  Consider using https://github.com/pawn-lang/YSI-Includes/blob/5.x/YSI_Core/y_testing.md to write them (look up unit tests), and see here for examples:  https://github.com/pawn-lang/YSI-Includes/blob/5.x/YSI_Core/y_core/y_cell_tests.inc#L218-L227<br />
<br />
6) The other big thing, the one we've been working hard on, is the code.  This is where we will need the most help, though it is already well under way.  However, right this minute it is not in a state suitable for general opening.  If you are interested in this, and know C++, tell us and we can move that forward.<br />
<br />
7) I'm bad at graphics.  We have some already, but more for promotion would be good.<br />
<br />
8) Small modes.  The examples that get bundled with a server.  We need our own ones of those.<br />
<br />
As I say, these are all little jobs that can be got on with while we sort out and organise the larger ones over the next few days.

Another way you can help is by contributing updated content to the wiki.<br />
<br />
Basically, mediawiki is dinosaur levels of old so I converted the old wiki into nice new markdown and deployed it with Vuepress: https://wiki.burgershot.gg<br />
<br />
Of course it's all on GitHub so you can just make pull requests to update it: https://github.com/openmultiplayer/wiki

Oh, was unaware your SA:MP discord was being used for the project. I've been banned from there for several months because I was being an annoying asshat and kinda got too annoying. I'll watch from the forums I guess. Thanks for the answer Southclaws &lt;3

Could be a good script function for cbug and 2shot, even if I prefer using both:<br />
Enable2ShotForPlayer(playerid, bool value);<br />
EnableCBugForPlayer(playerid, bool value);<br />
<br />
Same with Skinshot/Lagshot. It's sad that it is a server function instead of a script function. How about changing this if possible?

Competitive deathmatch relies on 2shot and c bug. I agree with DarkZero on this one.

C-Bug and other weapon related glitches should be toggleable instead of fixing them insantly, due to the reason above.

As for bugs, maybe create a specific topic? If there is, I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
From a very old post of mine (https://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=360803):<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDGFqemASAc<br />
<br />
The bug can be seen at minute: 2.34<br />
<br />
Things I figured out:<br />
1. Spawning results most of the time in sync, depends on who has spawned (the driver or the player).<br />
2. When Player A is driving and Player B is on the ship and synced and leaves the position and moves around and then comes back, the player is desynced. We then see these weird jumps in the video.<br />
3. When Player A is not driving and Player B is on the ship and is desynced and leaves the position and comes back to the position WITHOUT moving when he/she changed position, the player is still desynced.<br />
4. When Player A is not driving and Player B is on the ship and is desynced and leaves the position and comes back to the position WITH moving when he/she changed position, the player is synced when Player A starts driving the boat.<br />
5. It happens with both player objects and normal objects, however playerobjects are more susceptible to this issue.<br />
<br />
A small script to test this issue: http://pastebin.com/4bsmy7Zv, which requires the streamer plugin.<br />
It's old code, please have a look at OnPlayerCommandText what's going on.<br />
<br />
The code:<ul class="mycode_list"><li>/shipobject creates a normal ship, with CreateObjects.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="mycode_list"><li>/shipdynamicobject makes a dynamic ship, with CreateDynamicObject.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="mycode_list"><li>/slap<br />
</li>
</ul>
Slap yourself up onto one ship (remember which one it is) and do /savepos, move around a little and then do /pos, you will be teleported to the ship you were on. If this is the normal ship, everything is fine. However when you do the same with the dynamic ship, you get these weird jump issues. "<br />
<br />
^ Though it also appears to happen with CreateObject (see point 5).<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, I couldn't really point out the causing issue, however I tried to understand it as much as I could. Hopefully it's fixable.

This is great news, I love the part in the FAQ about making it an open source project, this will not only boost development but also prevent another halt in development as long as the community is strong enough. Definitely a step in the right direction, and I can't think of anyone else more appropriate to take it. Keep going Y_Less!

Yeah, I agree with Expert when it comes to some limits.<br />
You should go towards adding some features to o:mp by default, for example, streamer features, sockets by default, extend samp default http, json support because I'm sure there is lots of people who would like to make it easier to use apis (i think there is a plugin for that now).<br />
<br />
I think that would be nice and usefull.

Greetings, Alex! I am writing from the Russian-speaking community with a question for you! I don’t know English, so I’m writing through a translator. I wonder - Would you mind if we create our own group on VKontakte called "Open.mp", we will publish the latest news of your multiplayer in this group so that the Russian-speaking community is up to date with the latest multiplayer news, how do you like the idea?

Yes friends<br />
Only together we will make this project stronger!<br />
SA-MP dies <br />
The developer does not want to deal with it anymore<br />
he took off already many who wanted to develop SA-MP<br />
I've talked to many of the founders.<br />
And they will be ready to support open-mp<br />
Including even the largest projects<br />
We are all waiting for the completion of the development!

I'd be willing to help. I've got plenty of experience with C++, and I work as a backend/app developer too. My main focus will remain with GTA:UG, though.

I can take the responsibility for Turkish &lt;&gt; English translation and community management for Turkish users. I was the leader of the team that prepared the English courses for almost 5 million Turkish users on Duolingo. I also moderated the local forum page for those users and took care of the community's questions and problems.<br />
