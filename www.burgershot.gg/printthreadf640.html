As I have been playing SA-MP for loooong time, I always wondered if you could set the default running, walking and stanceÂ style. I was quite disappointed, when I found it is NOT possible to set it via code. There are obviously ways to make it into code, but they are not smooth enough and tend to get buggy usually (talking about applying animation with hotkey).<br />
<br />
My point of thread is that you could set any ped's walking, running and stance style. It is not present in SA-MP, but according to GTA SA coding, it should be possible.<br />
<br />
There could be also additional running and walk styles that are not present for normal peds, for example Wuzi, burglary sneaking etc.

This is something that we will discuss and add for the second release of OMP.<br />
<br />
All these kind of suggestions will only be added to the second version, as the first version is just compatibility to replace SA-MP
