<br />
As the title says, I need the stablest server OS (for example Ubuntu 14 is Stabler than 18.04) and the best server hardware (i7-7700K is "better performing" than i9-9900k(less tickrate but it's at least playable)

I think you should stick to Ubuntu 14 if you think that is fastest than ubuntu 18.<br />
But for me, i would like to have Ubuntu LTS which is 20.04.1 (for now) which is makes you not worrying about system upgrades or stuffs.<br />
<br />
And you can use LTS with i7 than i9 if you can change "Only processor" not entirely OS.

<br />
The unacceptable nickname issue (with the disconnect) is probably because of a bug in linux kernel versions of 4.9-4.19 that timeouts and disconnects players.
