Well, I've been in samp for about 6 years and since I have seen many types of servers, including one where the theme was medieval, the server is called Port Royale (it is in the Hispanic community) the fact is that they have been developing Gm for about 2 years and Not yet out. The server used the now non-existent version 0.3DL of the now almost dead SA: MP platform so I think the project failed (I would know about it but they banned me from its discord :P) So the intention of this post is to ask If doing something like this is possible, medieval cities, maps with such themes, horses, and everything you need to create something like that. I'm too interested in your opinion.

It's still in development, just far more hidden and secretive than before. :)

Are you not looking for a helper? I really like that server theme.Â I have average knowledge of pawn and I know how to map quite well. I mean, in case you need it. If not good, no problem. Good luck with that interesting project!

It looks interesting, although it really seems difficult to get a server like that. In other words, I would need a platform to help with its development. Samp's 0.3.DL was the closest it got.
