Well i think you dont need to start your every thread with "Hello samp friends".<br />
Roleplay gamemode costs much, because they have lots of funcinality and somebody needs to be developer for a year, because it takes a lot of time.<br />
You should search for developer who can write in pwn and has done it for many years.<br />
But it will cost you alot.

I didn't think it would bother anyone xD I guess I'll start to vary hahaha <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for the information, I would like to find a more advanced gm to customize it a little with what I know about pwn.

If you want an idea.  Just think about how much someone at McDonalds makes per hour.  Then think that programmers get paid 2-10 times as much.  Then you need to know that these modes can take hundreds of hours.  So work out a McDonalds wage, multiply it by 1000, and you have a reasonable answer.
