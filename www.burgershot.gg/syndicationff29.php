			<description><![CDATA[How is it going now with the progress of Open Multiplayer for GTA San Andreas? GTA San Andreas is a good game, and the sa-mp has a very good and stable source engine, so it will be something good i believe, even better than sa-mp if its backward compatibility.<br />
<br />
Would you be able to release it sooner if you have <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">more developers</span> on the engine? Or will it take similar time to release a beta version of Open.mp whether or not you get more developers?<br />
<br />
However the game will be great,<br />
<br />
I have a suggestion is that you put some adverts in the start of the screen, before the loading screen like in sa-mp, so you can gain money. Then you can pay some of the devloping cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game/engine will attract <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">many users</span>. Believe me, everybody remembers sa-mp, plus this game engine has backward compatibility with the old sa-mp so it'll be a very good multiplayer game, gta sa is just awesome ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
The open.mp website needs to be improved as well, so it'll be cool to browse it. If you need help with the website design i know a few websites where you could download themes for this, wordpress script is good as well if you post news and other stuff.]]></description>

<br />
Since partyserver went down on sa-mp, people been playing other games, but what happend to sa-mp forums? They were gone as well.<br />
Lots of people miss the old partyserver. Now this modification existed and is backwards compatible with sa-mp.<br />
<br />
Then Open.mp came along, but I cant find the partyserver on this application either.<br />
Will open.mp replace the old sa-mp client? Or what will happen? I just wanna understand since lots of players miss the old server.<br />
<br />
It's the real noxxer, so I miss how we trolled back then in partyserver, we have had good times in the servers since 2008, trolling and having fun with the game.<br />
<br />
I just need to understand what happend to partyserver and to this new sa-mp client?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Crazybobs CnR is undoubtedly one of the most popular servers in SAMP however this is now changing and there are many different reasons for this which I will mention below. Also if you don't want to read then scroll down to the bottom where you can find a 36 minute video which explains everything in detail. <br />
<br />
1) The owner of the servers, crazybob has abandoned the whole project. Even though he never officially mentioned this, he was last seen online somewhere in 2017. All attempts to contact him seems to go in vain and servers no longer receive any form of updates. Not even an update for Halloween or Christmas.<br />
<br />
2) This server was known for having the best anti-cheat system amongst SAMP servers but this is no longer true. There are now a few groups with the sole purpose of cheating and they seem to be online almost all the time. One such group is "snipergang".<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ftutS7sp7kI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qAx79pZ7lsE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
Some of the things they are able to do is :<br />
<br />
- Block admins and players from joining the servers.<br />
- Tamper with the anti-cheat system to ban admins and normal players.<br />
- Fly around the whole map while being invisible and kill players.<br />
- Teleport vehicles into players and killing them instantly.<br />
- And a lot more.<br />
<br />
3) With no owner to moderate the actions of the staff team, admin abuse has drastically increased and this caused many players to leave the community. There are many such cases of admins abusing players but obviously I can't mention all so here is one. Recently a player was approached by 2 admins and was told to sell his in-game house for &#36;100,000 which is the cheapest amount you can sell for. The player refused to do so and the admins proceeded to kill him over and over. They even fined all his money which eventually put him in debt. All because he refused to sell his house which he bought himself for him and his friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/psXaLQLce7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
<br />
In this video above you can see a player named "money". That is actually an account with admin status which a player bought from the admin. So yeah, someone else was using an admin account. That's the condition of this server now. If you want to know more about this visit the link below. This was written by the player who bought the admin account after he was caught and this should answer any questions you have.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazybobs CnR is undoubtedly one of the most popular servers in SAMP however this is now changing and there are many different reasons for this which I will mention below. Also if you don't want to read then scroll down to the bottom where you can find a 36 minute video which explains everything in detail. <br />
<br />
1) The owner of the servers, crazybob has abandoned the whole project. Even though he never officially mentioned this, he was last seen online somewhere in 2017. All attempts to contact him seems to go in vain and servers no longer receive any form of updates. Not even an update for Halloween or Christmas.<br />
<br />
2) This server was known for having the best anti-cheat system amongst SAMP servers but this is no longer true. There are now a few groups with the sole purpose of cheating and they seem to be online almost all the time. One such group is "snipergang".<br />

<br />
Some of the things they are able to do is :<br />
<br />
- Block admins and players from joining the servers.<br />
- Tamper with the anti-cheat system to ban admins and normal players.<br />
- Fly around the whole map while being invisible and kill players.<br />
- Teleport vehicles into players and killing them instantly.<br />
- And a lot more.<br />
<br />
3) With no owner to moderate the actions of the staff team, admin abuse has drastically increased and this caused many players to leave the community. There are many such cases of admins abusing players but obviously I can't mention all so here is one. Recently a player was approached by 2 admins and was told to sell his in-game house for &#36;100,000 which is the cheapest amount you can sell for. The player refused to do so and the admins proceeded to kill him over and over. They even fined all his money which eventually put him in debt. All because he refused to sell his house which he bought himself for him and his friends.<br />

<br />
In this video above you can see a player named "money". That is actually an account with admin status which a player bought from the admin. So yeah, someone else was using an admin account. That's the condition of this server now. If you want to know more about this visit the link below. This was written by the player who bought the admin account after he was caught and this should answer any questions you have.<br />
