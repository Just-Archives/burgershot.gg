How far is open.mp from launch?<br />
Currently it seems like there isn't any userbase at all and even the biggest names in samp scene have closed their servers.

We all need to be patient and accept that a release will occur when it does.<br />
<br />
I know partyserver was something good and then it closed down, now all sa-mp servers are mosly roleplaying, when open.mp launch then people will probably start good servers as well with deatch match etc.<br />
<br />
So we should wait and see ;)

Its obviously sad. open-mp promises to be backward compatible with SAMP. There seem to be no need atm to halt any project but IMO when the SAMP forum closed it was not well received from the server owner community. I think people thought Kalcor was gonna end SAMP but the thing is, it happened just after AGAIN another post 'DEMANDING' answers from Kalcor because he is inactive and I sense that he only closed the forum to get rid of THOSE. That was my 2 cent but,<br />
IN CONCLUSION: I think most ppl thought SAMP was gonna stop because the forum closed but IMO in reality there is no reason/need to end any project for SAMP.
