<strong>My [SAMP] Maps for Download/Display [Free, 01]</strong> - <a href="member671e.html?action=profile&amp;uid=3308">Pyraeus</a> -  <strong>2021-01-17</strong>
<br />
<br />
Good days, ladies and gentlemen, I am <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Pyraeus</span> and I am known as the '<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Moon Guy</span>' over on my You Tube Channel by some people (because my Majora's Mask Moon videos).<br />
<br />
I am here to post several links of several videos. There will be some displaying my work that is 'average' at best (Yes, I give myself that much low of a ranking) but ever since my last three clans; [FRAG], [IFG], and [KDC] have gone to shit and the people of the SA:MP forum never listened to my 'opinions' of draw distance (they were already having toxic public forum battles), I have been battling draw distance issues ever since... trying to perfect the best map with these limitations over SA:MP. I refuse to join MTA. I am an oldie but a goodie. Anyway, enough about me.<br />
<br />
So, I will display my videos here of my work and over time perhaps I will update the post? I will have new maps whenever I feel like it and it is all available for free to download. My videos contain a full timeline guide of everything that I did with detailed explanations. Thank you and have a good day. I will not most likely visit this forum as much and when I do I will respond to anything that you need, thank you. My You Tube Channel also contains a guide to SA:MP Map Construction and if you wish for me to post it here I will. My work involves existing interiors, places, and is really meant to help everyone who just needs a map or is starting out with a server.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">EDIT:</span> I just found out I can post five videos per post and so I will make another post like this, thanks.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">U Get [Budget] Inn Motel Room V.1. [Interior Fix/Download]:</span><br />
- The room where you meet Truth in the first GTA Mission gets a fix and a modification to polish the zone.<br />
[Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMOswDIaJdQ&amp;t=83s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMOswDIaJdQ&amp;t=83s</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Ryder's House V.1. [Interior Fix/Download]:</span><br />
- Everyone knows this place and it also has it's fair share of bugs. It also got a little bit of a polish to itself.<br />
[Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlIiCHOdI8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlIiCHOdI8</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Sweet's House V.1. [Interior Fix/Download]:</span><br />
- Same like the interior above as everyone knows it, but had a lot more unusual and weirder bugs then Ryder's House ever had. It also receives a polish.<br />
[Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRI4jNa7X9I&amp;t=279s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRI4jNa7X9I&amp;t=279s</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Gant Bridge Diner V.1. [Interior Fix/Download]:</span><br />
- This interior was a nightmare. It was used when CJ was dating Michele and it was all without collision... yes, ALL OF IT (Well, besides the seats), but nevertheless now it is not and also polished!<br />
[Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIrv1UIq94&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIrv1UIq94&amp;t=3s</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Blood Bowl V.1. [Arena + Racetrack Modification/Download]:</span><br />
- This remodifies Blood Bowl to an Arena of three epic floors (two for vehicle death matches and the third one for RC Baron vehicle death matches), provides it with a secret administrator room and updates the Racetrack sector of the game as well as the surrounding environment (adding mountains that surround the entire racetrack).<br />
