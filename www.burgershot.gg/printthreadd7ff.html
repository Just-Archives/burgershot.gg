We do understand that you’re not happy with the current situation, but we believe that starting another multiplayer project from nearly ground up seems counterproductive for an ancient game like GTA:SA. We love San Andreas - just as you do - although player counts are stable, we can’t deny it’s difficult to attract new players, especially considering the change in demographic.</span></span></span><br />

Talking about technical details, we think that implementing an SA:MP compatibility layer for MTA is totally possible and an optimal long-term solution. On the other hand it will also get you faster to an initial release (which we assume is one of your greatest problems).</span></span></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">To mention some stats: During the past three years, we released four new versions in addition to lots of rolling-release fixes and anticheat updates whereas the last official SA:MP release is more than four years ago (according to sa-mp.com).</span></span></span><br />

I am in no way representing open.mp community in this post, but here's what I think.<br />
<br />
If we, players, wanted to play/develop MTA, we would.<br />
<br />
SA-MP is a mod that's supposed to keep the credibility and looks of San Andreas, while MTA is a custom engine you can mod, and that's the main difference why many more players are better appealed by SA:MP (we hope open.mp in future). Check out this thread: <a href="showthreadba0e.html?tid=401" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.burgershot.gg/showthread.php?tid=401</a>

As a player my main issues with MTA are:<br />
<br />
1) MTA client is famous for being a pain in the ass to make run on linux with wine, to be fair it seems easy now using the latest wine, but I can see that being broken again with more MTA updates.<br />
While samp client on linux just works™ and hopefully open.mp client will too when it gets released many moons ahead.<br />
<br />
2) One MTA server didn't let me join, the error message from the server literally said it was because I was running wine. <br />
<br />
3) AFAIK MTA server doesn't support ARM while open.mp will.<br />
<br />
4) XML is fucking everywhere in MTA, fuck XML.

LUA is far superior language than PAWN. I don't know what are you talking about. MTA:SA has become something that open-mp will avoid, a custom game engine that you can script, most of the MTA servers do not feel like GTA:SA anymore.

My problem with MTA is: "Downloading 3,1GB before you can join the server.. current speed: 50kb/s". I have a 250 down connection.. Sure, great I love waiting ages before joining a server and then leaving again because it's not my thing! This happens with multiple servers. Especially the Roleplay ones that have everything modded.

Well, it is, but believe it or not, Pawn is getting updated to this date. But SA-MP is using the version from 2006. (maybe even from 2005. considering the mod first went public that year)<br />
You can see the development here: <a href="https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawnhistory.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawnhistory.htm</a><br />

In the meantime, I'd like to respond to a couple of things that were mentioned in this thread.<br />

It's true that MTA got something like a "custom engine you can mod". I personally don't think it's a restriction though. In the end, nobody forces anyone to create something that looks totally different from SA - it's the server's decision. Also, I think you inevitably end up with something like this if you add more and more features.<br />
<br />
Just a rough and spontaneous idea to address this issue: Perhaps it would help to introduce a server tagging system that allows for better filtering (e.g. "SA credibility").<br />
<br />

We invested some time a few months ago to make these components optional. This should have improved Wine support. Also, I know of a couple of people who actively use MTA on Linux.<br />
(2) It's true though that some servers block Wine. The reason is that essential anticheat components do not work on Wine and therefore simplify cheating a lot. So we decided to go for a trade-off that allows servers to block Wine. At the same time, we added scripting features that can be used for per-player whitelisting.<br />
(3) Technically, it's possible, but the demand for it was pretty low in the past.<br />

Unlike other languages, it was also implemented with focus on embedding in other applications - that's a big advantage, especially when it comes to securely using it for clientside scripting.<br />
Apart from that, let me mention an interesting project that was created by the MTA community recently: https://mta-slipe.com/. It essentially transpiles C# to Lua.<br />

I am really jealous of your client-side scripts, but that's about it. I wouldn't like my SA:MP server to compete with other MTA servers.<br />
Possible solution could be adding a whole another master list where you would have "Multi theft auto" and "San Andreas Multiplayer" servers where San Andreas Multiplayer servers would be limited on what can be done, but are able to switch to Multi theft auto whenever, thus, removing the limitations. I mean name "San Andreas Multiplayer" is by no means copyrighted, so yeah?<br />

It's been 14 years since SA:MP's release date... 14 years! And I could make huge lists of what could be done for SA:MP while still keeping the game's credibility.<br />
But it's true that I think SA:MP is really close to being a finished product.<br />
<br />
I spent good years on MTA's race-dm servers (DDC), but never wanted to develop my own server.

Why do you need open.mp's developers? <br />
Considering how much you've done with MTA, adding compatibility with PAWN seems like a week worth of coding.</blockquote>It's definitely more than a week of coding. Adding the PAWN virtual machine isn't the problem. The problem is that many SA:MP functions cannot be mapped directly to MTA as they behave differently. So you have to essentially translate all SA:MP function calls into a set of Lua instructions and transform parameters as needed.<br />
<br />
An alternative approach we've been brainstorming about is to implement a transpiler that actually "converts" PAWN code to Lua, similar to how https://mta-slipe.com transpiles C# to Lua. The feasibility of that approach depends a bit on the usage of showstoppers like the <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">#emit</span> statement (as it would require an additional bytecode to Lua transpiler), but the big advantage is that you can start immediately with adding new features.<br />
One of our developers has recently written a blog post about that matter: https://qaisjp.com/2019/04/24/exp-translate-pawn-to-lua.html<br />
<br />
We are in no way SA:MP or PAWN experts, so there are surely pitfalls we don't know about, but open.mp devs do. Also, it's about manpower.<br />

[...] Possible solution could be adding a whole another master list where you would have "Multi theft auto" and "San Andreas Multiplayer" servers where San Andreas Multiplayer servers would be limited on what can be done, but are able to switch to Multi theft auto whenever, thus, removing the limitations.</blockquote>Nothing would stop them from adding the tag unless it's manually managed by MTA moderatiors. I'm personally open for splitting the server list into categories, but I don't think they should be artificially limited as there'd be a pretty big gap between "SA:MP" and MTA servers then that is difficult to overcome.<br />

<br />
<br />
Before I say anything: Whatever I say is my personal opinion and not really related to OpenMP or the team.<br />
<br />
The thing is as some already noticed MTA and SA:MP are two different things, really different things.<br />
While MTA has been innovating SA:MP has been staying "true to the old spirit"; by a lack of updates and ignored feature requests.<br />
<br />
I for myself been playing MTA and SA:MP (MTA 2-3 years ago active; and 1-2 months after the OOP LUA addition) and after some time it got too heavy for me I've been using dated hardware back then (but way over the GTA:SA specs ofc) and had many problems regarding CEF after that even though I'm sure they are resolved by now.<br />
<br />
While SA:MP comes with close as none dependencies (archive file, main samp.dll, launcher and 1-2 files) MTA:SA comes with all the CEF files, CGUI files, locale files and so on (yes I know SA:MP statically links some stuff too).<br />
<br />
Merging both simply can't work in my opinion, they're too different and both have different goals from the public view somehow SA:MP remembers me of the old mods you drop into your game folder - and they work! MTA:SA is more of a "polished" and full fledged multiplayer modification for a mod and well people have preferences.<br />
<br />
Simply said:<br />
SA:MP -&gt; lightweight and easy to use but limited in more then a few aspects.<br />
MTA:SA -&gt; heavy but feature rich and sometimes a lil complicated oh.. and a bunch more stable than SA:MP (people use MTA:SA's crashfixes to resolve problems this tells much)<br />
<br />
But yes I don't think people would like that we have two different communitys and long term goals I guess and competiton and selection is healthy.

"Show initial download size in server browser" That's perfect! Looking forward to see this implemented. It will be great to just sort the server list by download size and try some servers that need less than 30mb.<br />

We should rather look for similarities than for differences, if we wanted this to work. And in case of specific differences, I'm sure it's possible to find a compromise.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, to be honest I don't agree with your theory. In my estimation, the goals of both projects are very similar. Just the implementation differs as a result of a different basis.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Some</span> servers on MTA don't look like GTA:SA, that's true. But the reason is not that they can't, they (some and only some!) just don't want to. From a technical perspective, there's nothing that prevents you from keeping the "true spirit" of GTA:SA. In case of SA:MP, you don't have the choice.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, I'm honestly a bit wondering what your goals are for open.mp. If you don't want to continue SA:MP's "lack of updates and ignored feature requests" (as you said it), you'll inevitably end up with diverging from GTA:SA's true spirit at some point (and that's perfectly fine in my opinion).<br />

I'm not a fan of XML either, but I don't think it's worth adding support for another file format for the meta file as it'd make things more complicated than they need to be (and cause fragmentation).

I think the greatest advantage would be the number of players that already play MTA, and the second one is the very advanced level of the features it has. Downsides: their forum is ugly, sorry.<br />

I like MTA, I would have played it more if someone made it compatible with fastman92's limit adjuster to be able to add vehicles, weapons, etc without replacing anything. I know many people here prefer to not make GTA SA a custom engine you can mod but I personally believe that decision should be left to individual servers.

I'm all for that offer. SA:MP has a large established community, MTA has something to offer this community, MTA gives developers almost unlimited opportunities, greater stability and a minimum number of bugs, and the fact that it is difficult - an excuse for the lazy. SA:MP just "shot faster" and took the initial piece of a large community, while MTA worked hard and gave server developers something that developers and players of SA:MP could not dream of. Choosing so many players is SA:MP - it's not because it's easy to use, just SA:MP was at the right time in the right place =)

<br />
@Jusonex: Some arguments may seemed a bit off but yea I was pretty tired writing this.<br />
<br />
Well; Simply said in my honest opinion MTA:SA is fine.. it's just not completely for me if I want to roleplay or dm; the extension of custom fancy modern content just ruins the "old-school" feelings for me, and yes sadly SA-MP did the same with the RL releases but that's still pretty limited compared to MTA:SA.<br />
I'm personally fine extending upon GTA:SA functions without needing custom made content.<br />
<br />
And to make something I said b4 clear:<br />
MTA:SA is more vanilla GTA:SA as SA-MP considering SA-MP disabled and failed to sync things like: (hydraulic / horn sync, disabled blur, disabled haze, disabled vegetation water plants etc and many other small things).<br />
BUT it provides content creators with a bunch of functions and ways (CEF, Dx drawing etc) or basically said power over GTA:SA and utilities to make it look they want. And that's one thing many people I know dislike about MTA:SA (excluding abnormal "community caused" download sizes which makes quick play for MTA:SA on bad net nearly impossible).<br />
<br />
SA:MP is your... well basic crappy but completely custom content hating competitor (ignoring the DL releases in that case) which gave a good mix and a good home for both parties. and well... Open MP focuses on SA:MP - your "competetion" or well let's say lame competitor when it comes to technical components.<br />
<br />
So that's why it won't probably fit.<br />
And I would contribute to MTA:SA whenever I could - but the community of developers is so big and communicative which fixes bugs and adds new things faster then I could recon them not playing MTA:SA or being involved in the community. <br />
Take this as an compliment (:

MTA would have been populated soo much earlier by SA:MP players if certain things were done. For example, as a beginner in Lua, I have found implementing clientside damage incredibly difficult and, when I asked for support on your forums, someone from your staff literally told me to "not implement clientside damage because the sync is just right in MTA". Hell nah, I've set the most effective rates possible in the MTA server settings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go__R7tGMBM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">and more than 50% of the bullet hits were not counted.</a><br />
<br />
You should pay more attention to the support request topics in your forum, because SA:MP server owners (like me, with hundreds of players willing to migrate to MTA) always ask for help but nobody bats an eye over there.

<br />
<br />
For years I have been waiting for something that could unify the playerbases, but I don't think centering on MTA is a good course of actions. Running scripts on MTA with a SA-MP compatibility layer would eventually make developers switch to the features of MTA and limit people with the SA-MP client. Opening servers to MTA players is a good idea, but regardless of its features (I have nothing against full modding support, Lua or XML), the focus should be on SA-MP servers and players.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.
