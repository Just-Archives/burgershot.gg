<strong>The new sa-mp modification</strong> - <a href="memberca74.html?action=profile&amp;uid=3956">NoxxeR</a> -  <strong>2021-07-13</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
Since partyserver went down on sa-mp, people been playing other games, but what happend to sa-mp forums? They were gone as well.<br />
Lots of people miss the old partyserver. Now this modification existed and is backwards compatible with sa-mp.<br />
<br />
Then Open.mp came along, but I cant find the partyserver on this application either.<br />
Will open.mp replace the old sa-mp client? Or what will happen? I just wanna understand since lots of players miss the old server.<br />
<br />
It's the real noxxer, so I miss how we trolled back then in partyserver, we have had good times in the servers since 2008, trolling and having fun with the game.<br />
<br />
I just need to understand what happend to partyserver and to this new sa-mp client?
<br />

GTA San Andreas and sa-mp is very good, its a very good game and people still remember each others. and the good times we had in the servers. :)<br />
<br />
Here is an example of how partyserver was back then:<br />

<br />
This multiplayer game should be updated, so people can have fun and play, I think it was because of the lack of funds that partyserver did die out. The donations was not sufficient enough and Ray close down the servers.<br />
<br />
There should be updates for sa-mp so people can have fun like back then.

Open.MP is still in development, there aren't public servers for it yet.<br />

Don't count on it. Kalcor already announced he lost interest some time before he took down the forums.<br />

Kalcor took them down. Idk why tho.<br />

It's 2021. Making money + samp don't really go together anymore. Fetch me the server files and I'll host it for free :P (Gaming should be about fun anyway, not money).

Sounds awesome, are you one of the programmers?<br />

If it was about the money, or servers, he should have asked for sponsorship, sa-mp is a good game so I dont understand why he put it down. <br />

I think you need to ask Ray Wilson, hes one of the main guys behind partyserver, death match servers are very good to have in sa-mp, people will enjoy their life if they play death match,<br />
<br />
Most of the servers right now are RP, thats not so good, lets hope they'll release a new partyserver again when Open.mp gets finished. :)
