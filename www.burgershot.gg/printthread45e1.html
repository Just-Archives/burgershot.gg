<strong>Some person spamming SA:MP forums member</strong> - <a href="member5cfe.html?action=profile&amp;uid=60">Gforcez</a> -  <strong>2019-07-06</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hey,<br />
<br />
There's this person that's spamming private messages to people advertising for Burgershot and open.mp. I assume this person isn't from the open.mp team, but before the open.mp team gets blamed again for being 'toxic' and what not, I like to report it. <br />
<br />
Clearly this person sends it to people who respond to "sa:mp is losing players" type topics. <br />
<br />

I wasn't quite sure where to post this. so I hope this category is okay.

GTA San Andreas cannot have a multiplayer modification, it is slowed down by people with too much complicated information and subjects.

Am I going to say it again, he's the most ridiculous client developer I've seen on the internet. Other people are better than him and he can't keep up a simple forum board, just wow.<br />

Don't need to be. This community should just get shut down because it has failed and messed up too many times. And Kalcor should stop SAMP too.<br />

Hmm, very kind that I did my part. Only now, you'll face a difficult future with this community. See how slow it takes for people to join. It means nobody is interested in your garbage. People already abandoning SAMP. This is what you get for ruining a decade year old classic. Is that how pathetic your life is?<br />
<br />
Leave a stupid worthless mirror of SAMP. Quit running a community you can't even handle anyway.

My posts here prove how you people take no responsibility for your actions. A clear image of how unstable the community is and that there is no healthy breathing room for regular people. Clear as can I say again: a corrupted staff. When is it about time that everyone starts confessing and so if they want to solve the conflict. You say you HATE drama, then why create it?

And for you, the only way to stop this "drama" is to call open.mp off?

A way to stop it is if the responsible people look at what they are doing and prevent the damage from now on or quit their ''community'' life.<br />
<br />
We innocent players shouldn't be bothered just because their parents didn't raise them properly.

What damage exactly are you talking about? And how exactly do you expect it to be prevented? You're beating around the bush.<br />
You obviously want SA-MP to continue existing - as do we. Kalcor refused to hand over the reigns so the logical consequence is that people move on without him. You'd have to convince him to do something about it, not the people from open.mp. This is already covered in Y_Less' statement, I suggest you read through it again.<br />
<br />
And about "us innocent people": everything we get with open.mp benefits the us, both the players and the developers.

Sorry, I can't be beating around the bush if there's an important reason why I was born and here to prove my point over your head. What else would I be doing here? I'm not crazy. I am here posting for a specific reason regarding information that have caused a lot of issues in SAMP and OpenMP. Are you trying to tell me that I didn't get to the point? This is strange, I already made my posts well clear.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about the damage from their actions in staff chats, Discord conversations, SAMP servers and so many more things that have affected innocent users too. I tried to tell them to stop, to prevent the damage they've caused. They didn't listen, so conflicts began and things got multiplied. We people wanted SAMP to continue existing, but it got ruined. This is Kalcor and Y_Less's responsibility a long with people from servers that are responsible too. The people from OpenMP with alternate accounts are exactly the same as they are from SAMP. No difference, just a mirror as I said before. It is just like Internet and Hosted tabs are the same. So where are you headed, exactly? <br />
<br />
I will NOT read Y_Less's statement because it is only a bunch of words where he claims he is special and better than Kalcor. I hate drama and I especially hate deception. <br />
<br />
Lastly, there is not a single healthy benefit to users when a leader causes instability across platforms and social media. Even so that Kalcor throws Google and Youtube out doesn't make the community fun. It is just boring for everyone. Multiply what I just said with Y_Less's actions and ask again how exactly pissed off I am.
