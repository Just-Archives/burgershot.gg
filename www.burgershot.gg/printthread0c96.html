<strong>Open.MP API</strong> - <a href="member0952.html?action=profile&amp;uid=205">Atom</a> -  <strong>2019-04-15</strong>
<br />
<br />
1: The option to allow or not, enter the server if the user has .asi or other files in their games folder.<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>OnPlayerHasAsiFiles(playerid)</code></div></div><br />
<br />
2: All keys<br />
<br />
3: Sounds from the server, as it is with the custom models in the 0.3.dl but with sounds.<br />
<br />
4: Obtain the resources of the pc in which the player enters, to create personalized options depending on your hardware, to optimize<br />
<br />
5: Voice Chat.<br />

<br />
EnableConnectionFromAnotherServer()</code></div></div><br />
<br />
7:A suitable browser that can be used in the game. It would be great to desing interfaces from html and css.<br />

i know we're still not very close to the release phase, but this feature is sometimes game changing and much needed. It'd be great if it were added as an optional feature.

I support idea 5, that the character has a microphone icon or something similar in his head, and thus add it as a personal minichat, in which when moving away it disconnects automatically.

<ol type="1" class="mycode_list"><li>Completely new dialog system:Â Timer-based dialogs (where the button can only be pressed after the time is passed and the time on the response button updates) in seconds,<br />
Dialogs with the ability to have upÂ to 4 responses,<br />

</li>
<li>Custom vehicle handling?<br />
</li>

</li>

</li>
<li>Screen based text labels - Like the one that shows up when you play audio stream with the same functions as mentioned in the dialogs one.<br />
</li>
<li>Checkpoint color customization with color codes?<br />
</li>
<li>Server sided timecyc?<br />
</li>
<li>Toggle for interior exits, garage doors, pay and sprays etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Updated textdraw API + textdraw movement.<br />
</li>
<li>Accurate timers?<br />
</li>
<li>Ability to switch weapons while in vehicle.<br />
</li>
<li>Cutscene skins added<br />
</li>
<li>Friendly fire for vehicles with a callback<br />
</li>
<li>Screenshot and chat typing detection.<br />
</li>
<li>Enable the disabled graphic stuff in SA-MP (vegetation, shadows etc)<br />
</li>
<li>Better audio streaming (+ playing mp3 which are linked in a specific folder + Incognito's audio plugin features)<br />
</li>
<li>Proper damage detection (vehicle ram/ heli blade/ car ram etc)<br />
</li>
<li>Removing the SetSpawnInfoEx or w.e. it is because the team parameter is broken<br />
</li>
<li>Unoccupied vehicles having the ability to take the damage.<br />
</li>
<li>Removing or changing the default ban system.<br />
</li>
<li>More options for OnPlayerClickPlayer, right now it only works when the name is clicked on the scoreboard.<br />
</li>
<li>Player oxygen related native<br />
</li>
<li>add cat pics<br />
</li>
<li>Resizing objects<br />
</li>
<li>Fixing the bypass to dialog inputs using copy-paste.<br />
</li>
<li>Vehicle crash patches<br />
</li>
<li>Discord rich presence please<br />
</li>
<li>Update the SQLite integration<br />
</li>
<li>SA-MP+ features (hi hual)<br />
</li>
<li>SoRt AnD fIlTeR fOr GaMeModEs, so we can filter out/ in TDM, DM, RP etc. in the launcher.<br />
</li>
<li>OnPlayerHoverTextdraw<br />
</li>
<li>Hiding vehicle icons in the map<br />
</li>
<li>Square and circle map icons (for players too)<br />

Coming from a roleplay world, the only reason for which I haven't played on FiveM yet is because of the voice chat being literally almost everywhere. I wouldn't want the voice chat to be natively implemented in OpenMP either.

Also adding custom map icons would be great.

I do agree that maybe we need more keys, but, I suggest adding <br />
"Custom Key 1"<br />
"Custom Key 2"<br />
"Custom Key 3"<br />
To the client, where the player himself can dictate which key is which.<br />
If you hardcoded the keys, players wouldn't be able to change them.<br />
<br />
If you just want it for a "custom input text", maybe just make the textdraw type "inputtext" ??<br />
I mean, for what do you actually need ALL keys.

I would rather use an external program such as Teamspeak orÂ Discord.</blockquote>Yes, for talking to your friends, it is indeed more useful to use discord than connect to an open mp server. But, for roleplay servers especially, a local voice chat (range based) or a radio chat for cops for example cannot be replicated using discord.<br />

<br />
<br />
On the VOIP topic, I completely agree that it is a good idea, albeit it should be toggleable by players and server developers should be able to limit it by range. But, it is vital that this should be implemented in a way that doesn't impact performance that much.

You don't need them. You already have more than enough.<br />
Think about games.<br />
Which games use letters K,H,U,L for anything?<br />
And even the ones that use those buttons, they're <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">changeable by the players.</span><br />
<br />
If you're struggling with the lack of keys, tell me what you need them for and I'll offer you a solution.

I gather from your replies that you are generally against trusting developers with full control over everything =))<br />
<br />
They are changeable by the player in any game because they have the privilege of not worrying about generalisations. They know they need a key for the team chat, a key for using an ability and so on. But the open.mp developers don't know what every server needs keys for. Some servers would not need any, while some would need numbers 1-3 for example, and others would need the key K and so on. Also, some servers would need 0 keys, while some would need 8, others 5 etc. If anyone should come up with a smart solution to still allow players to change the keys, while not limiting developers to 3 custom keys (maybe the possibility for the server to specify in a manifest what keys they need i.e how they should appear named in the user settings, and then the ability to use this keys as they've defined it?) I will be the first to give it a rep+ and suggest it whenever the topic should arise again, as I think this would be the ideal solution. But, if this is not possible, limiting the developers, in my opinion, is always a bad choice if it's not for the player's security.

BloodMaster, we're living in 2019 and we want to make features which are easy to use - we don't want command for every thing - using keys is one good solution, take a look at other games they can equally do the same, you can choose whatever key you like to use, the same can be done here, but with a little trick.<br />
<br />
I think all keys should be made accessible.
