This hasn't really been settled on but :<br />
<br />
There will only be one list, this list will contain <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">all</span> servers. The open.mp team is not planning on monetizing the project in any way, but <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">IF</span> they do : it would probably be by selling "boosts". "Boosts" would put your server at the top of the list, and as other people purchase server boosts your server will slowly move down the list.<br />
<br />
Pricing will certainly be <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">a lot</span> lower than a hosted tab spot in SA-MP.

That's just a bad business model as it will allow the richest servers to stay always at the top.<br />
What happens when somebody decides to sort by name or by ping or by number of players?<br />
<br />
Here's what I suggest for the monetize-model:<br />
Make "Premium" tab instead of "Hosted". Hosted literally means nothing, and you have to let your players know that they're joining a server that paid you to be on the list.<br />
Now, as for the pricing, I think it should be based around how many concurrent players the server has.<br />
If it was that way, we would finally see all those servers with 1000 players maybe decide that they no longer need the Premium/Hosted tab and allow some new servers to become competent.<br />
<br />
I think it would be reasonable that you should pay &#36;1-&#36;2 a month just to run a server with more than 50 slots in general as it would help the development and reduce the amount of 0 player servers.

You would only be able to boost your server once or twice a month. So as long as you've got just a few dollars you have the same chance as some of the biggest servers.

<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Maybe at this time it is too early to talk about it, but I think it would not be a bad option since from my perspective at some point or time this project should monetize to stay working and working properly since apparently this is very encerio, would come well 3 tabs like the current client SAMP favorites, official listing and premium something like that.<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Favorites: add your favorite servers</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Oficiasl List: list of all servers without exception</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Premium: Featured list of paid servers, (It would be nice if this type of tab or service offers something additional)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">In bases at the cost of this &#36;&#36; I think the most efficient would be to set an amount per month and not based on the players or slots of the servers, as well as the other would be the price to always maintain a good low price compared to the current customer .</span>

We were just discussing this what I personally think would be the best is to add a "verified" or "official" tab for now. More should be discussed only when the mod goes up, especially the client.

I propose the following categories:<br />
<br />
<ul class="mycode_list"><li><span style="color: #3366ff;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: large;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">All </span></span></span>(all servers that run an "announce" binary, including verified and premium)<br />
</li>
<li><span style="color: #339933;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: large;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Verified </span></span></span>(servers that have been quality-checked by the team, after having applied, including premium)<br />
</li>
<li><span style="color: #ffcc33;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: large;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Premium </span></span></span>(servers that are verified and also pay a small amount of cash: 2-3 USD/month)<br />
</li>
</ul>
This will ensure that serious server owners have priority over copy-pasters and scammers.

I thinks it's completely sufficient to have one master list with the option to filter by certain criteria like:<br />
* empty/not empty (checkbox)<br />
* password/no password (checkbox)<br />
* substring (inputfield)<br />
* category (dropdown)<br />
* language (dropdown)<br />
* ping (slider to choose a range)

There is a simple answer for that: There will be no hosted tab.
