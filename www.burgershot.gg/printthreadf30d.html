<br />
I made some changes to the Game Mode today, after a few hours I saw that the size of Game Mode amx increased from 4 MB to 19 MB.<br />
Compilation time also increased from 10 seconds to +60 seconds.<br />
I don't remember what I did that caused it <br />
even I optimizing well.<br />

Did you think changes would magically not change the AMX?  If you add things, things get bigger.

When viewed from its function. You can see that the size of the power usage in Pawno compared to VSCode is very far too. VSCode which has many features makes it feel very slow on a laptop with makeshift features like I use. So I think the compiled results in the new version of Pawn are not supported by the virus to load RAM while running the server. But my question is when creating a gamemode that people make. Why is there a play.exe program in the pawno folder? Is Play.exe a malware?<br />

<br />
I went back to the old versions of Game Mode pwn and I compiled those but it also AMX size more than 19 MB.<br />
I'm sure those versions didn't have this problem.<br />
I tried other compilers but it didn't change.<br />
<br />
Now I don't think the problem is with the game mode.<br />
<br />
I tried very hard to understand where the problem came from.<br />
Never mind...<br />

I know.<br />
But so far I have not done anything to make AMX more than 10 MB.<br />
I have 3 other Game modes with more than 60,000 lines, but their size has never been more than 10 MB<br />

That is the some russian guy compiler.<br />
No source code.

<br />
Number of lines are irrelevant - I can write a 1 line mode that's several gigabytes.  Code takes space, and different code takes different space.  What exactly do you think the problem is?  How much RAM do you have?

Sorry sir I have a question. Can you guarantee that play.exe is not a virus? because previously I had experience with GTA files which generally also speak like that but it turns out that in the end my laptop got a virus and the laptop's performance became slow, ahaha it's tragic even though at that time I trusted the program because I had often used the service but in the end I had been hit by a troublesome virus. I also now have no virus defense because the defender works harder than the virus.

No, that's why no-one uses it.

Cool you find it. Now the script can be rethought that the path starts at the left then right and goes down. How do you rebel so that the script runs from the opposite direction, namely from the right and then the arrangement of the road to the top?

I just explained that everyone has their own path and side. There are people who are extreme left-aligned. There are also right-aligned people.
