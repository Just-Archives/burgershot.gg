<strong>SA:MP Forums Situation</strong> - <a href="member2d11.html?action=profile&amp;uid=3015">Ty3ler_</a> -  <strong>2020-11-24</strong>
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">Hello all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Context: </span>I thought I would make this post because there is a huge amount of confusion around this topic and I have gathered some evidence and believe that we should all come together and discuss what is going on and give people <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">REAL FACTS</span>, supported by evidence.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">As the majority know, there is currently an ongoing situation with the SA:MP Forums and it's status. Recently, the SA:MP Forums became unreachable, throwing out errors at people and then later, telling us that the site cannot be reached.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">It has not been hidden in the SA:MP Community that over the past few years has been a real struggle against the community and the main developer</span> <span style="color: #c10300;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Kalcor </span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">who obviously lost motivation with his platform. He made several decisions that led to some members of the community taking his side and some going against him.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/B2rVySl.png" loading="lazy"  alt="[Image: B2rVySl.png]" class="mycode_img" /></span><br />
<br />
As visible in the image above, <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #c10300;" class="mycode_color">Kalcor </span></span>himself stated that he was "done" with SA:MP, this only being last year. This caused a lot of confusion and quite simply threw a roadblock infront of the SA:MP community and the updates they were receiving. This was just the start to the problems.Â  Around the end of 2019, start of 2020, something crazy happened.Â <br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #c10300;" class="mycode_color">Kalcor </span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">released a new update to SA:MP, several months after saying he was "done" with the platform. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">0.3DL </span>was a big hit for many and was taken up by the big servers such as <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Los Santos Roleplay </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Red County Roleplay </span>and all was seemingly going well. That was until later that year, the version was discontinued and removed from the SA:MP forums completely. There were alternative ways to find the version however, it was not supported by the developers of several communities. The biggest issue was yet to come though.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">During mid-late 2020, something that no-one was expecting happened. After the SA:MP Forums SSL certificate expired,Â </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #c10300;" class="mycode_color">Kalcor </span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color">took the decision to completelyÂ revoke the SA:MP forums and wiki from the main website as seen in the image below.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3DOGR5q.png" loading="lazy"  alt="[Image: 3DOGR5q.png]" class="mycode_img" /></span><br />
<br />
So let's wrap this up. The SA:MP Forums and wiki are gone and the likelyhood of them coming back is extremely slim (never say never). Don't get your hopes high. For those looking for a archive of the SA:MP Forums, use this link:Â <a href="http://samp.0xf0.xyz/forum.sa-mp.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">http://samp.0xf0.xyz/forum.sa-mp.com/index.html</a><br />

We warned you over a year ago that this will happen.

No one really knows what happened, all we can do is move forward and stick together to keep the community alive :)

He just own it, and other members administrate forum and moderators moderateÂ it by sections. I dont think Kalcor did anything moderation-related in last few years (well, except banning dev's). And that can't be the reason to shut down wiki aswell and remove the links from main page. Since few years ago, he claims sa:mp as 'dead' and this was sadly expected - as he got bored of the samp project and move on with life and newÂ projects.<br />
<br />
BTW: the link for forum mirror doesent seem to work. Its hit or miss, probably too much bandwidth put on server hosting it? I'd would love to atleast save few topics Im interested into as pdf for future reference as I have plan to make one last gamemode before leaving samp/openMP.
