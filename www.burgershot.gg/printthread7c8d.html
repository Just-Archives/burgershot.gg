Anyone else enjoy deathmatch on GTA 5? Not on online but on servers on fivem. Almost impossible to find since everything is RP but been playing one that's similar to old SAMP deathmatch servers like FoCo. <br />
<br />
Discord is Bishop#1527 if anyone wants to chat and play

I never enjoyed the glitch fighting on either of them. On SA-MP for as long as I played on stunt / dm servers, it always meant no-reload bug on sawn-off and dual SMGs, and c-bug on deagle. That's it.<br />
Haven't played on Five-M, but in GTA Online the only competitive deathmatch I see consists of dancing around with the heavy sniper like a retard. And if one of them gets pissed, they go on to use broken shit like the mosquito bike.<br />
Or they just start blowing themselves up to deny well deserved kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
GTA games weren't made for competitive gunfights. That's the cold truth, whether you guys accept it or not. You want competitive pure shooting, hit games like PUBG, Escape from Tarkov or ARMA.
