<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">No. Fixed release cycles require a level of predictability and support we just don't have right now. You need people who are guaranteed to be able to work on it at a very consistent level, but since the team are all volunteers there's no way to get this reliability. Things, mostly our jobs, get in the way.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Maybe if this gets bigger we'll eventually have the support required for this. But we don't yet. However, while we won't be able to say for certain when the next release will be, with this being open-source you will at least be able to follow along and see that things are happening. We’ll do our best to always communicate with the community and stay active online between releases!</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Short answer: Yes. 👮‍♂️✋🛑</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The longer answer requires explaining quite a lot about the internal architecture of the server. Everything uses a pub-sub event system. Incoming packets, outgoing packets, and callbacks are all sent around using this system, and modules (related blocks of functionality) can listen to all these events at various priority levels. There are several high priority levels dedicated to AC systems, and different modules can hook in to different events, potentially blocking them entirely. So we can have very small modules looking for specific different cheats totally independently of other code (this modularity was designed in from the very start for exactly this reason). There may not be one official huge anti-cheat, but there will be lots of modules detecting different cheats, and there's no reason they can't be bundled and distributed together.</span></span></span><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #8577CE;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="mycode_size">Will PAWN remain the "official" scripting language of open.mp? Can we use other languages?</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">All dev work, testing, and documentation, will be done in PAWN. ♟️</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">However, we have a C API which will allow anyone else to implement any other language! 🤖 The C API is used by PAWN itself, so any other language using the API will have exactly the same level of access to the internals as PAWN - as opposed to SA-MP scripting where other languages have to be integrated into PAWN scripts.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">We have also been discussing implementing some semi-official language modules, but PAWN is still the main and supported scripting language.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #8577CE;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">What is the dev team's stance on client-side scripting with other languages?</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Mixed. It is nice for some things, but also tricky to fully sandbox, which would be absolutely required were it to be added. As it stands, PAWN has been broken to the point of allowing arbitrary assembly to be executed from a compiled script. That's fine on a server, but not on a client.  So this needs patching out first. Using a different language would raise the question of why client and server are different, switching the server language would break the promise of backwards compatibility, and having two in any manner would double the support load.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The other idea thrown around is that of client-side plugins that they control and access from a central location. If your server needs the "Advanced Image Preview" client-side plugin, your server advertises this fact and a connecting client will either already have it or download it from the central repository. This gives everyone the ability to inspect exactly what code is being run on their own machine, build it themselves if they want to, and be certain of the provenance. The major downside to this is then hosting and vetting these plugins.</span></span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #8577CE;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="mycode_size">Will SA-MP plugins work on open.mp?</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The word "plugins" is now used to describe legacy plugins - the ones that were written for SA-MP (such as sscanf, MySQL etc) - and open.mp has an API to load these existing plugins. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Our new name for plugins going forward is "Modules" - this is the name given to any plugins (and internal code) that use the newer, far more expansive, API with open.mp.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Legacy plugins still work fine and will continue to do so, unless they use memory hacking, like YSF - that relies on addresses and structures which are just nothing alike in this server. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">But most of these old memory hacks were created to add features that will be native in open.mp, meaning we won’t need these plugins anyway!</span></span></span><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #8577CE;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="mycode_size">Will database functions be restricted to SQLite, or we can use MySQL?</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The default database functions are the same as they were before - SQLite. But, as stated above, open.mp has an API to load existing plugins, so we won’t need to change anything internally with regard to database functions - this can still be done via your existing plugins.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Third-party modules are fully supported and treated as first-class citizens in the code - callbacks and natives are all available to them in exactly the same way as to internal code, so there's no drawbacks to putting things in external modules. </span></span></span><br />
<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="color: #8577CE;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: medium;" class="mycode_size">Will there be more customisation for elements such as HUD, stamina, minigames (pool, gym, etc), different vehicle variants, vehicle indicators/turn signals, SA-MP+ features, etc? Will there be support for more customisable GUIs, as opposed to the limited textdraws in SA-MP? CEF? How will this stuff be protected?</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">We got soooo many questions about this sort of stuff, so grab a snack, this is gonna be a long answer! 🍿</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Having Hual (creator of SA-MP+) on our development team, who knows what the future will bring? 👀</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The major thing that differentiated SA-MP from MTA was expressed well in the names - SA-MP was literally "San Andreas Multiplayer", a multiplayer version of the game GTA San Andreas., while MTA is a more generic platform set in that world. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Features were added to SA-MP that fit closely with the feel of the original game, and while there are obviously ways that it has gone beyond those limits, things were still done very conservatively. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">We stuck with SA-MP this long because we preferred their approach, but we do want slightly more features (that's why we branched out in the first place), but we don't want to go too far. We will add new features, some of them won't have been in the original game, but we'll still carefully weigh the effects of each one. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Is allowing slightly wider dialog boxes a crazy addition that pushes the boundaries of what's considered canonical GTA? Probably not. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Is adding CEF too far? Yes - that won't happen. 🙅‍♂️</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The line is somewhere between the two.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">However, people have always been incredibly creative in what they could achieve with limited support already, and we’re sure that won’t change. We </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">will always encourage players and developers to be as creative as they like with the mod - hence why it’s open source -</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"> we’ll even help and support them in doing it, but it won’t be our primary focus.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">The primary concern is for the clients themselves. We don’t want server owners to be able to distribute anything potentially malicious. San Andreas was not designed for multiplayer or modding, and many of the loaders are not hardened against malformed files - there was simply no need. This is something that SA-MP struggled with when adding custom models, and this is a problem for us as well. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">Any part of the game we make customisable we have to first ensure there are no exploits in the file formats and loaders. We know for a fact that models and scripts have been compromised already, others may have also already been compromised and absolutely will be when we start adding arbitrary downloads to servers.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">As for asset protection, that’s simply impossible. To show a custom model to a client, you need to send them the custom model. Then, they by definition have the custom model on their computer. What they do with it from there is out of our hands. There are ways to make it slightly harder, but they aren’t foolproof. There are techniques that the web uses like DRM and secure enclaves, but they require sacrificing open-source principles to make them work. Look up the controversy surrounding </span></span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted_Media_Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url"><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">EME</span></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font"> and closed-source binary blobs inside Firefox.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">“Keys” isn't really the right wording. A better way to think about the existing functions is as “actions” - reflected in the new names - Player_GetActions, and OnPlayerActionChange. The client has never exposed “keys” to the server. Those you can listen into too much - we basically become a keylogger. This is also why there have always been codes to say “press JUMP to open”, because players may remap their keys so that what one person has for jumping is different to the next person.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">This is not a main focus at this point in time, but from a client point of view NPCs are exactly the same as normal players. We’d at least like our NPC functions to mirror that of FCNPC. This is definitely something we can look into for future releases.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000;" class="mycode_color"><span style="font-size: small;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-family: Arial;" class="mycode_font">It is exactly like a built-in streamer. However, it is more integrated than the streamer plugin, so we can stream vehicles and players as well, and mess around with local IDs in ways far beyond what the plugin does (it could in theory do the same things, it just doesn't).</span></span></span><br />

It's great to see that you have a good team and that the community trusts working on this mod. When it is released, I will definitely bring my server to open.mp.

the most annoying thing is that players when they go under water there is a breath bar that slightly goes slower time to time a missing feature for GTA:SA Lung Capacity but when lung capacity drops to 0 health rapidly iterates to a -negative value thus making the player die in a instance.<br />
<br />
GetPlayerLungCapacity(playerid, &amp;Float:capacity);

I have a simple question about the limitations that open-mp will have and it is: will it have an attachedobject limit to bones? (https://wiki.sa-mp.com/wiki/SetPlayerAttachedObject) (Samp has limit of 10)

Love your enthusiasm. Would love to see 0.3DL on first release so my can switch instantly to open.mp, but even if it won't be done, I hope we would see it quickly after that, thanks for all the hard work guys!

Logan's server would have 300 players at least daily if it was on 037 and not on DL, it got 100-150 like this at night<br />
Also, there are two servers on Balkan that get 60-70 which is 120-130<br />
So that's 200-400 players if you sum all (only for balkan) which is good because people here rarely try something new.<br />
<br />
Also, Skill Arena'd switch to DL too (+1000 players)<br />
<br />
so will all others follow Skill Arena (@Deity) and you'll have whole balkan on DL which is <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">a lot</span> of players

The best update thread you could ask for, great job team as always, I know full well that modding and most of open sourcing is a very thankless medium but always know there are a lot of fans rooting for the project and the well being of everyone involved.<br />

I think open source is a bad idea to begin with. May be let the project run for 12 months closed source first. Otherwise the community will be immediately divided into 10, 20, maybe even 100 different versions of the community. Keep everybody in one place to begin with.

Doesn't being open source give hackers a better opportunity to create clients that can manipulate a server? What's being put in place to prevent this.

Doesn't that also mean people who can fix safety issues, get a chance to do so in a much easier way than trying to disassemble everything too, just like any real reverse-engineer/hacker would do, and still "hack"?<br />
<br />
And yes, a lot of open source software does have bugs/faults that are more easily abused/misused, but it's not like closed source systems are that much better at security. SA-MP is a really good example..<br />
