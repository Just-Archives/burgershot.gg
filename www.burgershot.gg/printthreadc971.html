There is not a reason to constraint for special animations. However the sex animations are only in GTA SA 1.0 as far as I know.

In SA-MP those animations are restricted because probably they could get overused and Kalcor doesn't understand that it is +18 game. Animations shouldn't be restricted, MTA doesn't do that either.<br />

I vouch against implementing them. Even though they are there utilizing them for other servers to use is just kinda unnecessary. For a bunch of adults saying the game is rated eight-teen and over, go out and do the freaky not get an e-hard over a video game. You two wanna do something nasty over a video game? Grab each other's Skype, Snap, etc. No reason to necessarily need to do it over a game.

If in the future we will be able to add new animations there is no reason to block it.<br />
Fun part is that you can slit other players throat, shoot em, burn em, but dryhumping is 18+.<br />
It's like you must be 18+ to visit this site on r**tube, just hit yes and u good to go.

Nothing from the original game should be censored. Every single thing should be at least toggleable by either the server developers, players or both.

I completely agree with this. But these animations are in a gray area, because even though they were included in every original DVD of the game, they were also hidden because Rockstar didn't actually intended anyone to see them. <br />
<br />
Should said animations be accessible even though Rockstar did not intend to?<br />
<br />
Personally at first I would say they should be accessible because we all know GTA SA should have the +18 rating with or without sex, and it's not up to the mod developers to censor the game. BUT the Hot Coffee mod controversy happened only because the modding community found about these animations. Followed by a patch by Rockstar that completely removed the animations and everything related to them.<br />
<br />
So, taking everything into consideration, my personal opinion is that if we really respect Rockstar, then the animations shouldn't be accessible, as they weren't intended to be in the first place. Everything else is outside this gray zone and should not be censored.<br />
<br />

Also saying there's kids playing this game is not a real argument, because the game wasn't intended for kids in the first place. It's up to the parents censor inappropriate games to their kids AND what they do or have access to on the internet.<br />
<br />
All that being said this is useless because the developers take the final decision anyway :P

<br />
<br />
To be completely honest I don't mind at all if open.mp enables these animations, the oral sex animation at least should be enabled. One side of me actually wants every sex animation to be enabled and see every server using the animations having "+18" in their tittle. Only because fuck underage people, little dumb twelve year old kids shouldn't be playing this game in the first place. But my other side fears that Rockstar might notice and remind them of their most controversial days and have their lawyers send a cease and desist email to the good developers of open.mp. I don't want that to happen, I already lost one mod with a huge community arround it because of a simple cease and desist email. Can't let that happen again.

If we were to implement this stuff, we would need to enforce a strict policy to protect children. This would mean servers would be requires to inform the users that sexual material is present on the server and have them accept it, or we would need servers to hide this material for players who are under 18 (this will be hard to implement).<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, I don't believe this stuff needs to be added at all. I feel that we have gone this long without the need for them, and the only reason you need to use these animations would be for inappropriate usage.<br />
<br />
I am all for servers to have the freedom to do what they want, but some things need to be careful approached as the backlash could affect many users.

It's not a matter of adding stuff, but it's a matter of what animations have to be blocked at the client or server. Sure we need to a way to inform the user that a server might use explicit content and the user has to agree whenever it wants to play on the server or not. It is not possible to ensure that the user is legally allowed to play that game, however parents are entirely responsible for their own children. It is wrong to block game content even if it is explicit is just wrong in my opinion. Imagine we block everything that is explicit. People can do sex animations which is explicit, so that has to be blocked. Guns and drugs are explicit, so they have to be blocked aswell. Knifes allow to slit open throats so knifes have to be blocked. Characters can curse and say racial slurs, so all dialogs containing them have to be blocked aswell. The game is encouraging theft and murder so stealing vehicles and killing people has to be disabled. Is this still GTA San Andreas for you? Do you want to experience that game?

Don't see what the deal is with not allowing them and besides, this is going to go open source eventually so people will be able to add it themselves if it isn't implemented.

The fact is that server players can not do these systems from animations or systems, and they will not know about it for the role of play sex, then the most thing on Gambit RP full RP is where they download mods and have sex and not some children there, etc.<br />

right, server developers, for example, can not add these animations to the server using the dm mode  how are they killing each other, etc., and there are no houses, etc.<br />

role play server  developers will also want to do  do and on the role of the play server  I will be engaged<br />

And then ask the user for his birthday.<br />
<br />
This should be done even if the animations are disabled.

Age verification? guys its 2019! Any 4 years old can click a button to confirm they have 18.<br />
<ul class="mycode_list"><li>This game is +18.<br />
</li>
<li>Parents are responsible by their childs and what they're playing.<br />
