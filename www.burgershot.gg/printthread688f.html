<strong>Anything smartphone related</strong> - <a href="member0c02.html?action=profile&amp;uid=263">Wolf</a> -  <strong>2019-04-14</strong>
<br />
<br />
Thread to discuss about the newest smartphones, feautures, android updates, iOS updates etc.<br />
<br />
Recently I bought myself a Nokia 7 plus for &#36;342 (which was the lowest price in my country), and I gotta say, it's worth every penny. It's rigid (metal housing + a metal plate inside), has 4 gigs of ram, 64 gigs of storage, strong CPU, octa core, 6 inch screen... has everything I wanted basically.<br />
My only (and other's people) criticism is the stock camera software, which for a ZEISS camera, could be better. GCam fixes it though.<br />
<br />
Hope Nokia/HMD Global will bring even more surprises this year, cause so far they're doing pretty good.

I've got a OnePlus 3T (and before it a 1) and I've no reason to complain. I'm not a big phone guy so I just need it to work and not cost â‚¬999.

I have a J7 Pro (Samsung), blue, metal, has 4gb of ram, I think it's a good phone, I cost between &#36; 350 - &#36; 400 again.

I'm currently looking forward to the Librem 5.<br />
<br />
I've owned an iphone 6 before and upgraded (through contract) to an XS, which I kinda feel like was unnecessary. It was kinda cool when I got it, I liked the new features like AR and such, but it kinda faded and I don't really care anymore. At the end of the day it is just a phone. I wanted a newish device with iOS since I'm used to it and I like the stability, longevity of the device. Don't get me wrong, there are drawbacks to iOS and the Apple eco system, but I can live with it. <br />
Previous phones I've had were: <br />
<br />
Some old nokia, similiar to the 3310, but I can't remember much of it.<br />
Nokia 2700 First phone I got myself<br />
Samsung Galaxy S+<br />
Samsung Galaxy S3<br />
iPhone 6 and now the XS I probably won't buy another flagship, it was cool, but I've become desensitised to this stuff over the years. At the end of the day all I want from my phone to work, which in the old android days wasn't guaranteed.

it's a great phone except for the headphone jack being on the top right and the screen lighting up every time you touch the fingerprint sensor

Motorola G5(s)Plus 4+64GB, Dual Camera and all. The only complaint I have is that Moto devs can't code for shit and the camera software is just bad. I had to use a gcam port which takes amazing shots but bugs out sometimes and starts delivering Grey photos. Other than that, it's a pretty solid phone for a very low pricetag.

Coming from someone who works on Apple products but vouches for Android. Anything that isn't Apple, is decent. Apple, not so much.

It has been going in a downward spriral since the 7. The removal of the jack that for some reason (nearly) every manufacturer copies. The notch isn't that bad, you get used to it after a while.

I use Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus.<br />
<br />
I like Xiaomi phones. They are pretty cheap (if compare to other manufactures) and powerful.<br />
MIUI is also nice solution. But sometimes I feel that there are too much Chinese software xD

I use the Razer Phone, purely because of the battery and the amazing speakers. <br />
<br />
I used to have the Google phones like Nexus 5 and Nexus 6p. But Razer does it better and I like the square style over the rounded stuff most phones are going for.<br />
I might upgrade to the Razer Phone 2 if I feel it's worth it, which right now I am happy with my current phone. :D

BlackBerry Priv. Had 2 nokian phones before the smartphone age that both had full QWERTY keyboards and were amazing to type on. Ever since I got my first touchscreen smartphone typing has felt like a downgrade. I will never understand how humanity moved from physical buttons to tapping a solid glass pane.<br />
<br />
As for my current phone, yeah, slider phone with a full keyboard running Android, which is basically all I need. Camera is also amazing and battery life is solid.<br />
Feels like the phone is just a few years too old though, as the older smartphone processors really like to get hot and the Priv is no exception. Patiently waiting for BlackBerry to release a Priv 2 as I am not that fond of the Key series' screen size and aspect ratio.

Currently using the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Black Onyx) since March 2016. Had a signal problem later that year and managed to solve it in 2017. <br />

Other than that, it is my favorite phone and I will upgrade once it dies.

Is crDroid workÂ well?<br />
What's about cameras, heating level during using the phone and etc?<br />
Custom ROMs have some problems pretty often :/
