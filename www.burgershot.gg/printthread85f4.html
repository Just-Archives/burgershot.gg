<strong>Open Sourcing the Burgershot and open.mp Web Services</strong> - <a href="member461a.html?action=profile&amp;uid=1">Southclaws</a> -  <strong>2019-04-14</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hey allÂ ðŸ‘‹<br />
<br />
As many of you know, I love to open source <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">everything</span>. Even configuration files. I feel this benefits everyone because people can learn techniques and the underlying stack that supports their favourite websites and web services. But also, it provides a level of openness that facilitates the ability to directly contribute expertise and ideas to how services are deployed and configured.<br />
<br />
You can find all the deployment manifests and configuration for the websites and databases available in this repository:<br />
<br />
https://github.com/openmultiplayer/deployment<br />
<br />
If there's something about the site or configuration that you think can be done better or there's an issue that you know how to fix, simply open a pull request! The pull request will be reviewed by the team and if it's merged, the live site will be updated automatically.<br />
<br />
If any of you are interested in learning how all of this works, feel free to reply to this thread with your questions and I will update this post with a F.A.Q. style section of explanations.

Will there also be a repository of this forum? Since i do not see it in the openmultiplayer repositories list.

Maybe. It depends how simple the site source is to work with and deploy.

Don't you think that if you will open source OpenMP and it becomes large multiplayer platform someone will use it against successfully development? We live in 21st century, there is many people who thinks they can do everything unpunished.

Yeah, I'd like to know this as well. There are things have to be considered imo. Idk if this had been discussed already by the developers.

Would making the client open source leave unmodified servers vulnerable to attacks and also make it easier to develop hacks for OpenMP?

Yes but it would also make it easier (as in, more people would be able to) fix these vulnerabilitiesÂ and issues and allow the Open MP devs to take these fixes and use them to release an updated version quicker. People can discover and fix exploits before they're ever "discovered" and abused by the public.

<br />
If you have unlimited access even to closed source application, you can hack it, there are no exceptions for this rule.<br />
However if you don't publish source code of your application, you just hide its vulnerabilities (and there is special term for it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity).
