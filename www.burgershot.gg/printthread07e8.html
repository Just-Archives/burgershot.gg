Hello everyone, I wanted to ask you what weather conditions you prefer for a roleplay server, many have only one which is a clear day. But the question is if you would like to play in a more changeable weather such as: rain, fog, sandstorms, etc. <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">Your opinion will serve me too much</span>. Thank you!

Any weather i guess, while it is realistic it is fine for me.. for example sandstorm would be cool to have only in Las Venturas/Bone County. Most probably dont like fog because you cant see stuff and rain because it is hard to play in rain, like driving aint that easy, especially in a chase haha.. But I still think it is realistic to have rain and fog sometimes as well so yeah..

yeah i think fog and rain gave much realistic look<br />
though they are hard to drive and strive<br />
though sandstorm i like the idea and a city under water is what i like to see...
