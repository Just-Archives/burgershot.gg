Ideas is very nice, atleast stuff is clickable which is very good haha :D<br />
Design could be way better of course,  I just dont really like how all layout looks like and after selecting skin SAMP logo looks odd and SA map is super low quality which doesnt look good..<br />
And for me as a person who likes maps, I think now days it is waaaaay better when you have mapped login screens and skin selections, like it is 2021 and using old SA overworld or interiors is just kinda boring and for others it is like a cherry on top of ice cream you know :P<br />
Anyway, good job! :3

And as for the quality of the image / objects, I don't have more options because they are objects / images of the game and I have no option to change them..<br />
I appreciate the opinion offered, thank you.
