Don't take this as an official update, but I'm about half way though designing and writing the PAWN standard library. It will feature both a new API and multiple compatibility modes, which I will document later, so all existing PAWN scripts will work with almost no modifications needed to them. As I've written SA-MP gamemodes for nearly 7 years myself, I'm trying to design the new API looking at it from both implementer's and scripter's perspective. The new API will feature a new naming scheme, more tag safety and more consistency in general.

<br />
that's great news, but please keep in mind that the server owners need little (if no) modifications requirements to migrate to open.mp<br />
<hr class="mycode_hr" />
by the way, if the new dev section is a result of my suggestion, u deserve my applauds

Absolutely. Ideally the only necessary changes would be changing the standard library <span style="font-family: Courier New;" class="mycode_font">#include</span> line and adding a definition for compatibility mode in front of it.

As stated almost everywhere, we aim for flawless transition (as much as we can).<br />
Videos &amp; Pics can't be really shown in a nice way right now, there's nothing fancy to show in that case, many things happen in the back-end side of stuff.

I literally hate how some natives have the term "player" and some have "client", and the some natives use all small letters while the others use the upper camel case.

Yes, this will be taken care of. The naming scheme from <a href="https://github.com/Y-Less/pawn-curriculum/blob/master/module-3.md#style-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="mycode_url">Y_Less' PAWN Curriculum</a> is what I'm following when creating the new scripting API.
